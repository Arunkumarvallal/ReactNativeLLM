- Network connectivity indicator
- Theme toggle button
- Context status indicator

### 2. Download Your First Model

1. **Choose a Model**: Select a model based on your device's capabilities:
   - **Smaller models** (1-2GB): Better for older devices, faster responses
   - **Larger models** (4-8GB): Better quality responses, require more storage

2. **Start Download**: Tap the download icon next to your chosen model

   - Ensure you have stable internet connection
   - Download may take several minutes depending on model size

   - The "Continue" button will become active

### 3. Enter Chat Interface

1. **Navigate to Chat**: Tap the "Continue" button
2. **Model Preparation**: The model will prepare for first use (1-2 minutes)
3. **Ready to Chat**: You'll see "Model ready for conversation!"

## ðŸ’¬ Your First Conversation

### Basic Chat
```
User: Hello! Can you help me with React Native development?
AI: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with React Native development...
```

### Using Context (Optional)

The app supports context from markdown files for personalized responses:

1. **Enable Context**: Tap the database icon in the chat header
2. **Create Test Context**: Long-press the context button to create sample context
3. **Enhanced Conversations**: The AI will use your context for personalized responses

## ðŸ”§ Quick Tips

### Performance
- **Model Size**: Smaller models = faster responses
- **Context Length**: Shorter context = faster processing
- **Device Storage**: Keep 1-2GB free space for optimal performance

### Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All conversations happen on your device
- **No Internet**: Chat works offline once models are downloaded
- **Data Storage**: Messages persist until you clear app data

### Troubleshooting
- **Slow Responses**: Try a smaller model or restart the app
- **Download Issues**: Check internet connection and storage space
- **App Crashes**: Ensure sufficient device memory (4GB+ RAM recommended)
